This is our proposal for Mercedes-Benz' HerHackaton 2021 Challenge. 

## Requirements
![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white) 
![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/NPM-%3E7.5-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm&logoColor=white)

## Installation

For the frontend part you need to have npm installed so according to your operating system, please make sure you install it.

To install the Python package you can use pip:

```commandline
pip install git+https://github.com/green-code-evaluator/green-code-evaluator.git
```

## Usage

From your command line you can run:
```commandline
gcode analyze /home/user/example.py /home/user/results
```

The 'results' folder doesn't need to exist. If it doesn't, the tool will create it for you and populate it with the 
output coming from the analysis.

## Memory Profiling 

See how memory is being used with the [memory-profiling](https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/) package. 

```commandline
pip install memory-profiling
```

- To check your file code_to_analyse, and then the corresponding plot, run on your terminal :
```console
mprof run code_to_analyse.py 
mprof plot
```


Note : In order to have the corresponding functions appearing in the plot across time, '@profile' decorators are needed above each function definition. Read [here](http://fa.bianp.net/blog/2014/plot-memory-usage-as-a-function-of-time/) for more info. 

Example with bad_function.py 
```console
mprof run bad_functions.py 
mprof plot
```
